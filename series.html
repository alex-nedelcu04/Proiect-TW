                                The Clone Wars is an animated series that showcases the Republic's perspective of the Clone Wars, mainly through
                                 the eyes of Anakin Skywalker, his padawan Ahsoka Tano, and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi, but also from the point of view 
                                 of the clones themselves. The show explores different theaters of war on various planets and civilizations, depicting 
                                 how the protagonists, from their positions as generals and commanders in the Army, lead their men into battle against 
                                 villains like Count Dooku, General Grievous, and Darth Maul, who was thought to be dead after the events of Episode I.
                                
                             </p>
                            <p>It also offers insight into Anakin's mind, his close bonds with his wife, Padm√©, and his master, Obi-Wan, as well as his role
                                 as a "big brother" to Ahsoka. The events and struggles depicted in the show illustrate his gradual turn to the dark side, by 
                                 the end of thw seriea his turn being a matter of "when" rather than of "if".

                                     and of that period of time in general.

                            <p> Rebels is an animated series that primarily showcases how Ezra Bridger, a young Jedi, and Kanan Jarrus, a more experienced Jedi
                                 who served as a Padawan in the Clone Wars, try to survive under the Empire's regime‚Äîa period when all Jedi who survived Order 66
                                  were hunted down. It also includes other storylines that intertwine with this main one, such as Darth Maul plotting to kill 
                                  Obi-Wan Kenobi (and ultimately failing) and Ahsoka being a key figure in the early days of the Rebellion.

                                <p>The series was well received, though it often fell short of people's expectations, being seen as a "lesser" show than <a href="series.html#clone-wars">The Clone Wars</a>, which ran concurrently for

                            <p> The Bad Batch is an animated series that centers around a group of defective clones whose genetic flaws were specifically exploited to make them enhanced soldiers. The story follows them as they take in and protect a young 
                                female clone named Omega. The show serves as a continuation of <a href="series.html#clone-wars">The Clone Wars</a>, extending beyond the events of Revenge of the Sith. The Bad Batch, as the group is called, were unaffected by the programming change that turned 
                                clones against the Jedi, due to their deviations from the standard clone template.
                            </p>
                            <p>The series also depicts the harsh transition from the Republic to the Empire, including the decommissioning of clones.

                            <p> The Book of Boba Fett is a mini-series (only one season) that explores Boba Fett's return after being presumed dead and his quest to take control of
                                the criminal underworld on Tatooine. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Having first re-emerged in <a href="series.html#the-mandalorian">The Mandalorian</a> Season 2, Boba Fett's story is heavily linked to that of Din Djarin, serving as a bridge between the second and 
                                third seasons of The Mandalorian. Boba Fett's rise to power after his absence wasn't easy, as he ends up facing off against old enemies, but with the help 
                                of The Mandalorian and Grogu, he manages to come out on top.

                            <p>The series had mixed reactions. On one hand, people were happy to see fan-favorite Boba Fett again. However, the main critique was that the show wasn't really 
                                focused on Boba Fett's story (contrary to what the title suggests), but more on The Mandalorian's. As such, The Book of Boba Fett was labeled by many as an unofficial 
                                season of <a href="series.html#the-mandalorian">The Mandalorian</a>.

                                <p> Obi-Wan Kenobi is a mini-series that takes place about 10 years after the events of <a href="movies.html#episode3">Revenge of the Sith</a>. It presents the life of the Jedi Master with the same name, while in exile on Tatooine, hiding from the Empire
                                     while also overseeing Luke to keep him safe from his father finding out about his existence and whereabouts. Leia is also being protected in a similar manner by Bail Organa, who adopted her and raised her as his own.


                                </p>
                                <p>Obi-Wan is forced to temporarily leave his cover to save Leia after she is kidnapped by the Empire. The series also introduces the Inquisitors into live-action (previously only appearing in Rebels), a group of dark Force users 
                                    trained by Darth Vader himself with the objective of hunting down Jedi. In his journey to save Leia and subsequently deliver her safely back to Alderaan, Obi-Wan fights these Inquisitors and even Darth Vader himself.

It masterfully explores the psychological impact Anakin Skywalker's turn into Darth Vader had on Obi-Wan.

                                <p>The tragedy of the situation is highlighted, as he blames himself for creating this monster and tries to make things right in the least way he can by ensuring that Vader doesn't find out about the twins and turn them into weapons. 
                                    Plus, the nostalgic aspect of Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi coming head-to-head again helped the series leave a long-lasting impact on viewers.

                                    Andor is a series set five years before the events of Rogue One and centers around Cassian Andor. At this time, Cassian is not yet the committed freedom fighter seen in the 2016 movie. 
                                    He's more self-centered, but the experiences he undergoes transform him into a true Rebel.

                                    The series provides a grounded perspective on life under the Empire's dictatorship. It focuses on everyday people, no Jedi, generals, or politicians, who face the brutal reality of the Empire's rule. 
                                    Cassian witnesses the horrors inflicted by the Empire in prisons and across society, and these experiences spark the fire of rebellion within him.
