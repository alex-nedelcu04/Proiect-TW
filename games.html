                            <p>Jedi: Fallen Order is the first game in the "Jedi" series developed by Respawn Entartainment and published by EA and it follows the story of a 
                                young former Padawan, turned scrapper, named Cal Kestis. The action takes place during the rule of the Empire, a period when Jedi were hunted by Inquisitors and Darth Vader. 
                                Cal's cover is blown after he saves the life of a work friend, leading to the Inquisitors chasing him. He meets Cere, a former Jedi, and her pilot Greez, who rescue him.

                            </p>
                            <p>Cal, tired of all the running he has endured since <a href="series.html#clone-wars">The Clone Wars</a> and his master's death during Order 66, wants to help others like him across the galaxy. He and Cere begin 
                                searching for a holocron that contains information about the identities and locations of numerous Jedi, hoping to bring them together and restore the Jedi Order. After being 
                                closed off from the Force out of fear and trauma, Cal relearns the teachings of his master along the way, eventually facing Darth Vader himself.

                                <p>The game was well received by fans because of the depth and quality of its narrative, even surpassing some of the movies released around that time. It also offered a fun and 
                                    unique experience with lightsaber and Force combat. The world-building was also praised, as every planet visited had its own history and charm.

                            <p> 
                                Jedi: Survivor is the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order and takes place several years after the first game. Cal Kestis, now a more experienced Jedi, continues to run from the ever-increasing 
                                reach of the Empire and ultimately finds new people who share his revolutionary views, which end up being a precursor to the Rebellion.

                                The game improves on its predecessor by exploring even more planets, each with different people and customs, but united in their desire to overturn the evil Imperial rule. 
                                Cal's Force abilities are also expanded, showcasing different uses of the Force than have been seen before.
                            </p>
                            <p> The game was generally well-received by fans for continuing Cal's story and embracing even more of his Jedi traits, particularly his desire to help others. However, it left a 
                                lot to be desired when it came to optimization. Overall, it was a worthy sequel and a great addition to the Star Wars franchise.

                                <p> Star Wars Battlefront I & II are two combat games developed by DICE and published by EA that focus on player vs. player fights, although the second game also includes a campaign mode. 
                                    Players can choose from a multitude of characters such as Jedi, Sith Lords, Rebels, Clones, and other notable personalities from the Star Wars franchise. Both games are similar in terms of
                                    mechanics, although Battlefront II came with a whole array of new characters, especially from the Sequel Trilogy that had just begun, as well as new game modes and Force abilities.
                                </p>

                                <p> The campaign mode of Battlefront II takes place between the events of <a href="movies.html#episode6">Return of the Jedi</a> and <a href="movies.html#episode7">The Force Awakens</a> and follows Imperial Commander Iden Versio as she defects from the Imperial army to join the 
                                    New Republic, while also uncovering the ways in which Emperor Palpatine was preparing for his eventual death.

                                <p>Overall, the games are now well-liked within the Star Wars community, even though Battlefront II was surrounded by controversy at launch because of the introduction of microtransactions that saw characters
                                     like Darth Vader locked behind a paywall, on top of the already high price of the game. The fans reacted, and EA ended up backtracking on this idea and made everything available for everyone, leading to 
                                     the game seeing success afterward.

                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p> Star Wars Outlaws is an open-world game developed by Massive Entertainment in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games and published by Ubisoft. It is the first 
                                Star Wars game of its kind and the first in a long time that wasn't published by EA.
                            </p>
                            <p> As the title suggests, the game takes a deep dive into the criminal underworld of the Star Wars universe, where scoundrel Kay Vess participates in various 
                                activities such as battling rival outlaws, stealing goods, and infiltrating secret locations to uncover numerous mysteries.

                            <h3>Reception</h3>
                            <p> The game received underwhelming reviews, mainly due to the steep price and numerous technical issues that gave the impression it was released unfinished. Additionally, 
                                the story isn't very compelling or engaging, with a major criticism being that, while the open-world feature is impressive, the developers relied too much on it without
                                 putting enough thought into other aspects of the game.
