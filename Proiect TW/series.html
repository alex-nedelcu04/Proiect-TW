                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p> Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is the first movie in The Prequel Trilogy, 
                                serving as the beginning of the story chronologically. The action takes place during                                     the era of the Republic (32 BBY) and follows Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi 
                                    as they attempt to resolve a diplomatic crisis that, if left unchecked, could escalate into 
                                    a full-scale war between the Republic and the Trade Federation.
                             </p>
                            <p> During their journey, they encounter a young slave named Anakin Skywalker, whom they ultimately 
                                    decide to take under their wing due to the belief that he is "The Chosen One," prophesied to bring 
                                    balance to the Force.
                            </p>
                            <p> The Sith, long thought to be extinct, have reemerged, posing a serious obstacle to ending the conflict peacefully.

                                <h3>Reception</h3>
                                <p>The movie received a mixed reception from fans and critics upon its release. On one hand, fans were excited to see the
                                     first new film in 16 years, but on the other, many felt it didn't live up to the standards set by the Original Trilogy. 
                                     The main criticisms centered around the overly political nature of the plot, the pacing, and the way the movie handled its
                                      comedic moments. Characters like Jar Jar Binks were seen as out of place in serious circumstances, detracting from the gravity 
                                      the film was attempting to portray.</p>
                                <p>Recently, however, the general consensus has shifted, as is often the case with movies or series set in the Republic era, 
                                    for reasons we will explore later.

                            <p> Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is the second movie in The Prequel Trilogy, set ten years after the events of 
                                    Episode I. It shows how the relationship between the Republic and the Separatist forces, led by Count Dooku (a former Jedi
                                    who has turned to the dark side), has reached a breaking point.

                                    Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, now the master of 19-year-old Anakin Skywalker, is sent on a mission to discover the culprit behind 
                                    a failed assassination attempt on Senator Padm√© Amidala. While tasked with protecting her, Anakin falls in love with the senator 
                                    and former queen of Naboo. Meanwhile, Kenobi learns of an army of clones created at the request of a late Jedi, Sifo-Dyas, in 
                                    anticipation of a great war.

                            <p> Anakin, Padm√©, and Obi-Wan are kidnapped by Geonosians, allies of the Separatists, and their rescue marks the beginning of the Clone Wars 
                                    as Chancellor Palpatine orders the deployment of the newly found clone army on Geonosis.

                                <p>The movie received a mixed reception from fans and critics upon its release. While many praised its efforts in terms of world-building and marking the 
                                    beginning of the Clone Wars, others were left unimpressed by the often "cheesy" dialogue, the romantic subplot, and the overall rushed feel of the action.

                                <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p> Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the final movie in the Prequel Trilogy, set three years after the events of Episode II. 
                                    It showcases the last few months of the Clone Wars and Anakin Skywalker's tragic turn to the Dark Side.
                                <p> Chancellor Palpatine pushes Anakin closer to darkness by feeding into his mistrust of the Jedi Council's methods and by convincing him that the Dark Side is the only way to save the life of his now-pregnant wife, Padm√©.
                                     When Palpatine reveals himself as a Sith Lord, Anakin notifies the Jedi Council, but, to his disbelief, he still hasn't earned their trust. When he learns of Mace Windu's plan to kill Palpatine for his crimes, Anakin 
                                     protests and ultimately intervenes to aid the Sith Lord, solidifying his turn and marking the birth of Darth Sidious's newest apprentice, Darth Vader.

                                </p>
                                <p> The movie's ending is tragic: the clones turn against the Jedi on Palpatine's command, the Republic transforms into a dictatorship led by Emperor Palpatine, and former master and apprentice Anakin and Obi-Wan engage in a final 
                                    battle. Obi-Wan ultimately wins by exploiting Anakin's greatest flaw, his arrogance. The battle leaves Anakin burnt and deformed, leading to his iconic life-support suit.

                                <h3>Reception</h3>
                                <p>The movie was the most well-received of the Prequel Trilogy, appreciated for its exploration of Anakin‚Äôs psychological descent and the way it transforms Darth Vader from a symbol of tyranny to a tragic figure subjected to the power 
                                    of the Dark Side. It also effectively highlights the Empire's ruthlessness.
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, it serves as a worthy entry in the Star Wars franchise, narratively paving the way for <a href="#"> The Original Trilogy </a>.

                            <p> Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is the first movie of the original trilogy and the first movie released overall in the franchise. 
                                    It follows the story of Luke Skywalker, a boy from a desert planet called Tatooine, who, through meeting some droids and an old former 
                                    Jedi named Ben Kenobi, becomes involved in an intergalactic conflict between the Empire and the Rebels who have rallied against its dictatorship.

                            </p>
                            <p> With Kenobi's help, Luke learns how to use the Force, which proves useful in his and his friends' (Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Chewbacca) quest to 
                                    aid the Rebellion by destroying the Death Star.
                            </p>
                            <p> The Sith, long thought to be extinct, have reemerged, posing a serious obstacle to ending the conflict peacefully.

                            <p>To say the movie was well received would be an understatement. It became a global phenomenon, surprising audiences with how far ahead of its time it was. 
                                    Even without modern CGI, this 1977 film holds up better than some movies released in the 1990s. The world-building and storytelling captivated the masses, 
                                    who demanded more, and so the movie that was initially titled simply titled "Star Wars" became just the start of a whole new universe.
