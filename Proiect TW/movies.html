                                <p> Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace is the first movie in The Prequel Trilogy, 
                                    serving as the beginning of the story chronologically. The action takes place during 
                                    the era of the Republic (32 BBY) and follows Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi 
                                    as they attempt to resolve a diplomatic crisis that, if left unchecked, could escalate into 
                                    a full-scale war between the Republic and the Trade Federation.
                                </p>
                                <p> During their journey, they encounter a young slave named Anakin Skywalker, whom they ultimately 
                                    decide to take under their wing due to the belief that he is "The Chosen One," prophesied to bring 
                                    balance to the Force.
                                </p>
                                <p> The Sith, long thought to be extinct, have reemerged, posing a serious obstacle to ending the conflict peacefully.

                                <h3>Reception</h3>
                                <p>The movie received a mixed reception from fans and critics upon its release. On one hand, fans were excited to see the
                                     first new film in 16 years, but on the other, many felt it didn't live up to the standards set by the Original Trilogy. 
                                     The main criticisms centered around the overly political nature of the plot, the pacing, and the way the movie handled its
                                      comedic moments. Characters like Jar Jar Binks were seen as out of place in serious circumstances, detracting from the gravity 
                                      the film was attempting to portray.</p>
                                <p>Recently, however, the general consensus has shifted, as is often the case with movies or series set in the Republic era, 
                                    for reasons we will explore later.

                            <p> Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones is the second movie in The Prequel Trilogy, set ten years after the events of 
                                Episode I. It shows how the relationship between the Republic and the Separatist forces, led by Count Dooku (a former Jedi
                                 who has turned to the dark side), has reached a breaking point.

                                Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, now the master of 19-year-old Anakin Skywalker, is sent on a mission to discover the culprit behind 
                                a failed assassination attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala. While tasked with protecting her, Anakin falls in love with the senator 
                                and former queen of Naboo. Meanwhile, Kenobi learns of an army of clones created at the request of a late Jedi, Sifo-Dyas, in 
                                anticipation of a great war.

                            <p> Anakin, Padmé, and Obi-Wan are kidnapped by Geonosians, allies of the Separatists, and their rescue marks the beginning of the Clone Wars 
                                as Chancellor Palpatine orders the deployment of the newly found clone army on Geonosis.

                            <p>The movie received a mixed reception from fans and critics upon its release. While many praised its efforts in terms of world-building and marking the 
                                beginning of the Clone Wars, others were left unimpressed by the often "cheesy" dialogue, the romantic subplot, and the overall rushed feel of the action.
