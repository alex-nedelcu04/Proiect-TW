                                <p> Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is the first movie in The Prequel Trilogy, 
                                    serving as the beginning of the story chronologically. The action takes place during 
                                    the era of the Republic (32 BBY) and follows Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi 
                                    as they attempt to resolve a diplomatic crisis that, if left unchecked, could escalate into 
                                    a full-scale war between the Republic and the Trade Federation.
                                </p>
                                <p> During their journey, they encounter a young slave named Anakin Skywalker, whom they ultimately 
                                    decide to take under their wing due to the belief that he is "The Chosen One," prophesied to bring 
                                    balance to the Force.
                                </p>
                                <p> The Sith, long thought to be extinct, have reemerged, posing a serious obstacle to ending the conflict peacefully.

                                <h3>Reception</h3>
                                <p>The movie received a mixed reception from fans and critics upon its release. On one hand, fans were excited to see the
                                     first new film in 16 years, but on the other, many felt it didn't live up to the standards set by the Original Trilogy. 
                                     The main criticisms centered around the overly political nature of the plot, the pacing, and the way the movie handled its
                                      comedic moments. Characters like Jar Jar Binks were seen as out of place in serious circumstances, detracting from the gravity 
                                      the film was attempting to portray.</p>
                                <p>Recently, however, the general consensus has shifted, as is often the case with movies or series set in the Republic era, 
                                    for reasons we will explore later.

                                <p> Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is the second movie in The Prequel Trilogy, set ten years after the events of

                                    who has turned to the dark side), has reached a breaking point.

                                    Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, now the master of 19-year-old Anakin Skywalker, is sent on a mission to discover the culprit behind 
                                    a failed assassination attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala. While tasked with protecting her, Anakin falls in love with the senator 
                                    and former queen of Naboo. Meanwhile, Kenobi learns of an army of clones created at the request of a late Jedi, Sifo-Dyas, in 
                                    anticipation of a great war.

                                <p> Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the final movie in the Prequel Trilogy, set three years after the events of Episode II. 
                                    It showcases the last few months of the Clone Wars and Anakin Skywalker's tragic turn to the Dark Side.
                                </p>
                                <p> Chancellor Palpatine pushes Anakin closer to darkness by feeding into his mistrust of the Jedi Council's methods and by convincing him that the Dark Side is the only way to save the life of his now-pregnant wife, Padmé.
                                     When Palpatine reveals himself as a Sith Lord, Anakin notifies the Jedi Council, but, to his disbelief, he still hasn't earned their trust. When he learns of Mace Windu's plan to kill Palpatine for his crimes, Anakin 
                                     protests and ultimately intervenes to aid the Sith Lord, solidifying his turn and marking the birth of Darth Sidious's newest apprentice, Darth Vader.

                                </p>
                                <p> The movie's ending is tragic: the clones turn against the Jedi on Palpatine's command, the Republic transforms into a dictatorship led by Emperor Palpatine, and former master and apprentice Anakin and Obi-Wan engage in a final 
                                    battle. Obi-Wan ultimately wins by exploiting Anakin's greatest flaw, his arrogance. The battle leaves Anakin burnt and deformed, leading to his iconic life-support suit.

                                <p>The movie was the most well-received of the Prequel Trilogy, appreciated for its exploration of Anakin's psychological descent and the way it transforms Darth Vader from a symbol of tyranny to a tragic figure subjected to the power 
                                    of the Dark Side. It also effectively highlights the Empire's ruthlessness.
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, it serves as a worthy entry in the Star Wars franchise, narratively paving the way for <a href="#original-trilogy">The Original Trilogy</a>.

                                <p> Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is the first movie of the original trilogy and the first movie released overall in the franchise. 
                                    It follows the story of Luke Skywalker, a boy from a desert planet called Tatooine, who, through meeting some droids and an old former 
                                    Jedi named Ben Kenobi, becomes involved in an intergalactic conflict between the Empire and the Rebels who have rallied against its dictatorship.

                                </p>
                                <p> With Kenobi's help, Luke learns how to use the Force, which proves useful in his and his friends' (Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Chewbacca) quest to 
                                    aid the Rebellion by destroying the Death Star.
                                </p>
                                <p> The Sith, long thought to be extinct, have reemerged, posing a serious obstacle to ending the conflict peacefully.

                                <p>To say the movie was well received would be an understatement. It became a global phenomenon, surprising audiences with how far ahead of its time it was. 
                                    Even without modern CGI, this 1977 film holds up better than some movies released in the 1990s. The world-building and storytelling captivated the masses, 
                                    who demanded more, and so the movie that was initially titled simply titled "Star Wars" became just the start of a whole new universe.

                                <p> Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is the final movie of the Original Trilogy. It follows a now-experienced Jedi, Luke Skywalker, 
                                    on his quest to save his kidnapped friend Han Solo and to foil the Empire's plans of building a new and improved Death Star, which the evil 
                                    government intended to use to destroy all who opposed them for good. Luke is still dealing with the aftermath of finding out Darth Vader is his father, 
                                    and during the film, he learns that Leia is his twin sister. Together, the Millennium Falcon crew leads the Rebellion in a final attack on the Empire by targeting the 
                                    still-under-construction Death Star II.

                                </p>
                                <p>The action culminates in a showdown between Luke, Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine. After multiple attempts to recruit Luke, Vader begins fighting him under the Emperor's orders. 
                                    In a shocking twist, Darth Vader turns on the Emperor, killing him to save Luke. By the end of the fight, the Death Star is collapsing, and Luke is unable to save his father, the now-redeemed Anakin Skywalker.

                            The Sequel Trilogy is the first and currently only trilogy released after Disney acquired the rights to the franchise from Lucasfilm. It was created as part of Disney's desire to bring back the beloved 
                            characters of <a href="#original-trilogy">The Original Trilogy</a> and to build on what was already established, exploring new directions that Star Wars could take.

                                <p> Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens follows the story of a scavenger named Rey, who ends up caught in the conflict between the New Republic and the First Order, an organization that rose 
                                    from the ashes of the Empire. With Palpatine and Vader gone, their roles have been taken by Supreme Leader Snoke and his apprentice Kylo Ren (formerly Ben Solo), the son of Han and Leia. Kylo's 
                                    obsession with his grandfather Darth Vader's legacy pushed him toward the Dark Side.

                                </p>
                                <p> The New Republic's Resistance, led by Leia, along with the help of Rey and a former stormtrooper named Finn, deals a significant blow to the First Order by destroying their Starkiller Base, a superweapon
                                     capable of annihilating entire solar systems. The movie ends with Rey finding Luke Skywalker, who was revealed earlier to have gone into hiding.

                                <p>The movie was fairly well received by fans and critics, mainly due to the nostalgia of seeing Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Luke Skywalker on the big screen again. It also served as a strong setup that left fans 
                                    excited for what was to come in the next two movies. However, some were left unimpressed by the numerous parallels drawn between this movie and <a href="movies.html#episode4">A New Hope</a>, which, to some, made it feel more like a remake than a truly 
                                    original standalone movie.

                                     Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is the second film in the Sequel Trilogy. It follows the aftermath of Rey finding Luke and learning that he has isolated himself out of fear, blaming himself for Ben Solo's
                                     turn into Kylo Ren, who is now Supreme Leader and more determined than Snoke to completely wipe out the Resistance. The First Order seeks revenge and chases the Resistance across the galaxy until they reach a New 
                                     Republic outpost on the planet Crait.

                                    The First Order vastly outguns the Resistance, as the New Republic was unable to fund a large enough army. Just when the galaxy's fate seems bleak, Luke uses all of his remaining life 
                                    force to project himself across the galaxy, aiding the Resistance and ultimately holding back the First Order.

                                <p>The movie's reception was largely negative. It undid many of the exciting story threads that <a href="movies.html#episode7">Episode VII</a> had set up and completely changed the character of Luke Skywalker, transforming him from a hero who never gives up into an old man 
                                    who disconnects from the Force and abandons his mission after facing a significant obstacle as a master. Additionally, the New Republic's lack of cooperation with the Resistance seems nonsensical, as the New Republic is supposed to be 
                                    governed by former Rebels who understand the danger of an army like the First Order and the importance of stopping such evil from seizing control of the galaxy.

                                <p>
                                    The beloved character Finn, who seemed poised to transition from a former enslaved stormtrooper to a Jedi, was reduced to an afterthought, with every hint of Force sensitivity removed. The movie also feels like a remake of <a href="movies.html#episode5">Episode V</a>, with the evil 
                                    army seeking revenge after the destruction of their base and staging a battle on a white planet, though this time the snow is replaced by salt.

                                <p> Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker is the final movie in the Sequel Trilogy and in the Skywalker Saga as a whole. The movie begins with the shocking revelation that Emperor Palpatine is alive and plotting his revenge with an army stationed on the planet Exegol.
                                     Rey and her team must first locate the planet to end the conflict as quickly as possible. Kylo Ren, too, seeks Exegol, as he wants to determine whether he can control this army or if it's a threat he needs to confront.

                                </p>
                                <p>Both the Resistance and the First Order eventually make their way to Exegol, where they encounter Palpatine himself, who reveals several surprises. He was behind Snoke all along, implying that Snoke was just a clone created as 
                                    part of Palpatine's attempts to clone himself. Ultimately, Palpatine reveals that he is Rey's grandfather, a shocking twist considering she was previously thought to be "a nobody," as Kylo Ren had put it, just an orphan with no 
                                    significant heritage. Kylo Ren, upon seeing what he is up against, has a change of heart and joins Rey to defeat Palpatine once and for all, sacrificing himself in the process.

                                <h3>Reception</h3>
                                <p>This movie, like <a href="movies.html#episode8">The Last Jedi</a>, received overwhelmingly negative reviews. Fans and critics alike criticized the decision to resurrect Palpatine, as it undermined Darth Vader's redemption. Additionally, the reveal that Rey was a Palpatine was confusing, as it contradicted the idea that Rey, 
                                    who was neither part of the Skywalker family nor any notable Force-sensitive lineage, could still be powerful with the Force—an idea that suggested anyone could become a great Jedi regardless of their background. Finally, Kylo Ren's redemption felt rushed, and many believed it would have been 
                                    a more fitting choice for him to remain the only Skywalker to die still under the influence of the Dark Side of the Force.

                                    The movie concludes with the rebels successfully transmitting the plans, narrowly escaping Darth Vader's pursuit and ultimately delivering them into the safe hands of Princess Leia Organa, setting the stage for the original Star Wars saga.

                                <p>The movie was widely praised by fans and critics for bringing something new to the Star Wars universe, a story that wasn't centered on the Skywalker family. 
                                    This fresh approach allowed viewers to experience the galactic conflict from the perspective of everyday people whose lives were shattered by the Empire's oppressive rule. 
                                    The film highlighted the courage and resilience of these individuals, giving depth to the Rebels' fight. It also portrayed the Empire's ruthlessness and arrogance, as they continued
                                     developing the Death Star despite knowing about a small vulnerability, one they deemed too insignificant to be exploited.

                                <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p> Solo: A Star Wars Story is set about ten years before the events of A New Hope and follows a young Han Solo as he matures into the smuggler we later encounter. 
                                    The film details how he meets Lando Calrissian and comes to possess the Millennium Falcon, as well as the origins of his deep bond with Chewbacca. 
                                </p>
                                <p>                               
                                    It also showcases the criminal underworld of the Star Wars universe, featuring characters like Qi'ra, who becomes the public face of the Crimson Dawn after betraying Solo,
                                     while Darth Maul remains the puppeteer from the shadows.

                                <h3>Reception</h3>
                                <p>The movie received underwhelming reviews from fans and critics. Many felt the origin story of Han was rushed, as many key events in his life occurred within the span of a week, making his character 
                                    arc feel incomplete. Additionally, it came at a low point in the Star Wars franchise, only a few months after the release of the controversial <a href="movies.html#episode8">The Last Jedi</a>. People were not happy with the direction Disney was taking the Star Wars saga, and the negativity spilled over into this movie.
 
                                </p>
                                <p>It wasn't the success Disney was hoping for, and so the plans for a Solo trilogy and any other projects under the Anthology umbrella were canceled.</p>
