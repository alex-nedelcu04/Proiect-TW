                    <p> Welcome! This guide is designed to help you
                        navigate the vast amount of Star Wars media available and gain 
                        a better understanding of what to expect from each movie, series 
                        or game.

                        <h2> Why use a guide?</h2>
                        <p>
                            It's helpful to have a place that sets you up with all the information you might need before 
                            starting something new from the Star Wars franchise, such as a general, spoiler-free overview, 
                            a summary of the general consensus around the content, official trailers, and even details on its success (money and viewership-wise) 
                            for those interested.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plus, another important aspect: At first, consuming any sort of media seems pretty straightforward, right? You just start with the first thing that was 
                            released and then continue watching in order of release until you finish everything. However, Star Wars isn't that simple. 
                            To give you an idea, the first movie is called Episode IV, and Episode I was released 22 years later. As such, people employ 
                            two different strategies for watching Star Wars:
                        
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Release order</li>
                            <li>Chronological order </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now, let's take a look at both approaches, and by the end, you should be able to make an informed choice on which one works best for you:
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <hr id="subsection-divide">
                    <section class="release">
                        <div id="release-order-text">
                            <h3>Release order</h3>
                            <p> This is it the way Star Wars creator George Lucas, and later
                                Disney, intended the media to be consumed. As such, the
                                original storytelling is preservered and the plot twists
                                and reveals are not in danger of being spoiled by something 
                                you have already seen.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                A good example is a reveal in Episode V (1980) that is very 
                                shocking if this is only the second movie you see. However,
                                it ends up being just an obvious fact if you've seen Episode I (1999). 
                                Plus, you follow the evolution of technology available, so
                                you notice visual imprevements with every new project 
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Here is a visual representation of the order of the movies
                                in Release Order. (Only movies + The Clone Wars animated series,
                                for simplicity):

                            <h3>Chronological order</h3>
                            <p> This means watching based on in-universe timeline so that
                                you expereience the action in a linear fashion. It is
                                a good choice if you don't like jumping back and forth 
                                between events that happen 30 years apart, in very
                                different historical contexts, with diffrent characters.
                                The biggest drawaback is that you lose some of the mistery 
                                and intrigue that the viewer was intended to experience, 
                                but at least you are at a smaller risk of confusing events and 
                                misunderstandng when and why something happened.
                            </p>
